<h1 align= "center"> Hi there I'm Seba! 👋 </h1>

𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫, Biologist, passionate about learning…    I specialize in MERN and PERN development stack (MongoDB/PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, ReactJS/Redux, NodeJS). Experienced with all stages of the development cycle for dynamic web projects. I enjoy logic, handling data, and solving problems.

I have developed a Single Page Application (SPA) where I consume an API of [videogames](https://github.com/sebamuchut/PI-Videogames-FT14a). Some of the features include game search, filters by genre, alphabetical order, and rating. I also implemented a feature to add new games. 

Together with other developers we have built an [E-commerce (craft beer app)](https://la-montaner.vercel.app/). Some of the features include: Administration of shopping cart and product orders; Differente types of product filters; Payment gateways integration; Transactional e-mails (mailgun); Product discount systems; User administration and password management; Product Owner login to administrate commerce (add, modify and delete data), and a small game where customers can win discounts.

Previously I worked as a [scientist (evolution and morphology of plants)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian-Muchut) and college professor. Yes! I went from science to technology! As a scientist, I learned the importance of correct data management, discipline, and teamwork. As a professor I learned the importance of clear explanations and adaptation according to audience. I am now looking for that place where I can contribute my skills and expand my knowledge in the world of technology.
